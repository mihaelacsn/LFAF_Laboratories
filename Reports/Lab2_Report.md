## Theory
Some notions I found important and useful: <br>

**Automaton** <br> - mathematical model for finite-state machines.
<br>
**Determinism** (in automata theory) - when the result of the transition from one state to another depends on the input. 
<br>
**Finite Automata** - machine that recognize patterns within input taken from alphabet and accept it or reject it.
<br>
**Deterministic finite automaton (DFA)** - type of finite state machine that accepts or rejects an input string based on a set of states and transitions between those states.
<br>
**Non-Deterministic finite automaton (NDFA)** - type of finite state machine, but unlike DFA, it can transition to multiple states at the same time for a given input symbol.
<br>
**Chomsky hierarchy** - a hierarchy of four types of formal grammars (Type 0, Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3).

## Objectives

1. Understand what an automaton is and what it can be used for.

2. Continuing the work in the same repository and the same project, the following need to be added:

    a. Provide a function in your grammar type/class that could classify the grammar based on Chomsky hierarchy.
    
    b. For this you can use the variant from the previous lab.

3. According to your variant number (by universal convention it is register ID), get the grammar definition and do the following tasks:

    a. Implement conversion of a finite automaton to a regular grammar.
    
    b. Determine whether your FA is deterministic or non-deterministic.

    c. Implement some functionality that would convert an NDFA to a DFA.

    d. Represent the finite automaton graphically (Optional, and can be considered as a bonus point):
